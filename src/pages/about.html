            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Blockchain creates trust between different entities where trust is either nonexistent or unproven. As a result, these entities are willing to engage in business dealings that involve transactions or data sharing that they may not have otherwise done or would have required an intermediary to do so. The enablement of trust is one blockchain's most cited benefits.</p>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">In a decentralized blockchain network, no one has to know or trust anyone else. Each member in the network has a copy of the exact same data in the form of a distributed ledger. If a memberâ€™s ledger is altered or corrupted in any way, it will be rejected by the majority of the members in the network.</p>
